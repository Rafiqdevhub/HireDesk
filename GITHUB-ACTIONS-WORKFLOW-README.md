# 🚀 HireDesk GitHub Actions Workflow

## 📋 Workflow Overview

The `tests.yml` workflow provides comprehensive CI/CD testing for the HireDesk application with 4 parallel jobs:

### 🧪 Job 1: Unit & Integration Tests

- **Matrix Strategy**: Tests on Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- **TypeScript Validation**: Runs `npm run typecheck`
- **Test Execution**: Runs all 49 tests with coverage via `npm run test:coverage`
- **Coverage Upload**: Uploads to Codecov (when token is configured)
- **Duration**: ~15 minutes

### 🏗️ Job 2: Build Validation

- **Production Build**: Validates `npm run build` works correctly
- **React Router Build**: Ensures client/server bundles generate properly
- **Bundle Analysis**: Reports asset sizes and build artifacts
- **Artifact Upload**: Saves build files for deployment usage
- **Duration**: ~15 minutes

### 🔍 Job 3: Code Quality Analysis

- **TypeScript Configuration**: Validates strict mode and type generation
- **Project Structure**: Ensures required files and directories exist
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Documents Vitest + jsdom + RTL setup
- **Quality Metrics**: Reports on code organization and standards
- **Duration**: ~8 minutes

### 🔒 Job 4: Security & Dependency Audit

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Runs `npm audit` for security issues
- **Dependency Analysis**: Reviews key dependencies (React Router v7, Vite, etc.)
- **Audit Reporting**: Saves results as artifacts for review
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies potential security concerns
- **Duration**: ~8 minutes

### 📊 Job 5: Test Summary & Reporting

- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: Markdown summary of all job results
- **Phase 2 Achievements**: Documents testing infrastructure success
- **Status Overview**: Clear pass/fail status for each job
- **Phase 3 Readiness**: Confirms readiness for advanced testing
- **Final Decision**: Passes/fails workflow based on critical jobs

## 🎯 Trigger Conditions

**Automatic Triggers:**

- Push to `master`, `main`, or `develop` branches
- Pull requests targeting these branches

**Manual Trigger:**

- `workflow_dispatch` for on-demand execution

## 🏆 Success Criteria

**Critical Jobs (must pass):**

- ✅ Unit & Integration Tests
- ✅ Build Validation
- ✅ Code Quality Analysis

**Advisory Jobs (monitored):**

- 🔒 Security Audit (continues on warnings)

## 📊 Phase 2 Integration

This workflow perfectly complements your Phase 2 testing infrastructure:

- **8 Test Files**: All test files executed and validated
- **49 Unit Tests**: Comprehensive coverage of hooks, services, utilities
- **Vitest + jsdom**: Modern testing environment working correctly
- **Mock Patterns**: API, File, and service mocking validated
- **Error Handling**: Network errors and edge cases covered
- **React Router v7**: Build and test compatibility confirmed

## 🚀 Ready for Phase 3

With this workflow in place, you have:

- **Automated Quality Gates**: Every commit/PR validated
- **Multi-Node Testing**: Compatibility across Node.js versions
- **Security Monitoring**: Continuous vulnerability scanning
- **Build Verification**: Production readiness confirmed
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Clear visibility into test status

Your HireDesk application now has **enterprise-level CI/CD testing** that will support advanced Phase 3 development including E2E testing, performance monitoring, and cross-browser validation!
